# API Playground

Here lies an example API, built with Flask. So, you'll need [Flask](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/2.2.x/). After that, run `flask run` in this folder :-)

The entry point of the project is `app.py`.

Also included in this project is a small collection to help play around with the playground. You can import this into [Insomnia](https://insomnia.rest/) to make calls to your lovely api server.
